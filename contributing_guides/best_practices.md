# Engineering Principles, Style, and Correctness Guide

## Principles and collaboration

- **Use 1-way vs 2-way doors.** For 2-way doors, move faster and iterate. For 1-way doors, be more deliberate.
- **Consistency > being “right.”** Prefer consistent patterns across the codebase. If something is truly bad, fix it everywhere.
- **Fix what you touch (selectively).**
  - Don’t feel obligated to fix every best-practice issue you notice.
  - Don’t introduce new bad practices.
  - If your change touches code that violates best practices, fix it as part of the change.
- **Don’t tack features on.** When adding functionality, restructure logically as needed to avoid muddying interfaces and accumulating tech debt.

## Style and maintainability

### Comments and readability
Add clear comments:
- At logical boundaries (e.g., interfaces) so the reader doesn’t need to dig 10 layers deeper.
- Wherever assumptions are made or something non-obvious/unexpected is done.
- For complicated flows/functions.
- Wherever it saves time (e.g., nontrivial regex patterns).

### Errors and exceptions
- **Fail loudly** rather than silently skipping work.
  - Example: raise and let exceptions propagate instead of silently dropping a document.
- **Don’t overuse `try/except`.**
  - Put `try/except` at the correct logical level.
  - Do not mask exceptions unless it is clearly appropriate.

### Typing
- Everything should be **as strictly typed as possible**.
- Use `cast` for annoying/loose-typed interfaces (e.g., results of `run_functions_tuples_in_parallel`).
  - Only `cast` when the type checker sees `Any` or types are too loose.
- Prefer types that are easy to read.
  - Avoid dense types like `dict[tuple[str, str], list[list[float]]]`.
  - Prefer domain models, e.g.:
    - `EmbeddingModel(provider_name, model_name)` as a Pydantic model
    - `dict[EmbeddingModel, list[EmbeddingVector]]`

### State, objects, and boundaries
- Keep **clear logical boundaries** for state containers and objects.
- A **config** object should never contain things like a `db_session`.
- Avoid state containers that are:
  - overly nested, or
  - huge + flat (use judgment).
- Prefer **composition and functional style** over inheritance/OOP.
- Prefer **no mutation** unless there’s a strong reason.
- State objects should be **intentional and explicit**, ideally nonmutating.
- Use interfaces/objects to create clear separation of responsibility.
- Prefer simplicity when there’s no clear gain
  - Avoid overcomplicated mechanisms like semaphores.
  - Prefer **hash maps (dicts)** over tree structures unless there’s a strong reason.

### Naming
- Name variables carefully and intentionally.
- Prefer long, explicit names when undecided.
- Avoid single-character variables except for small, self-contained utilities (or not at all).
- Keep the same object/name consistent through the call stack and within functions when reasonable.
  - Good: `for token in tokens:`
  - Bad: `for msg in tokens:` (if iterating tokens)
- Function names should bias toward **long + descriptive** for codebase search.
  - IntelliSense can miss call sites; search works best with unique names.
  - “Fetch versioned implementation” is an example of why this matters.

### Correctness by construction
- Prefer self-contained correctness.
  - Don’t rely on callers to “use it right” if you can make misuse hard.
- Avoid redundancies:
  - If a function takes an arg, it shouldn’t also take a state object that contains that same arg.
- No dead code (unless there’s a very good reason).
- No commented-out code in main or feature branches (unless there’s a very good reason).
- No duplicate logic:
  - Don’t copy/paste into branches when shared logic can live above the conditional.
  - If you’re afraid to touch the original, you don’t understand it well enough.
  - LLMs often create subtle duplicate logic—review carefully and remove it.
  - Avoid “nearly identical” objects that confuse when to use which.
- Avoid extremely long functions with chained logic:
  - Encapsulate steps into helpers for readability, even if not reused.
  - “Pythonic” multi-step expressions are OK in moderation; don’t trade clarity for cleverness.

## Performance and correctness

- Avoid holding resources for extended periods:
  - DB sessions
  - locks/semaphores
- Validate objects:
  - on creation, and
  - right before use.
- Connector code (data → Onyx documents):
  - Any in-memory structure that can grow without bound based on input must be periodically size-checked.
  - If a connector is OOMing (often shows up as “missing celery tasks”), this is a top thing to check retroactively.

---

## Repository conventions: where code lives

- Pydantic + data models: `models.py` files.
- DB interface functions (excluding lazy loading): `db/` directory.
- LLM prompts: `prompts/` directory, roughly mirroring the code layout that uses them.
- API routes: `server/` directory.

---

## Pydantic and modeling rules

- Prefer **Pydantic** over dataclasses.
- If absolutely required, use `allow_arbitrary_types`.

---

## Data conventions

- Prefer explicit `None` over sentinel empty strings (usually; depends on intent).
- Prefer explicit identifiers:
  - Use string enums instead of integer codes.
- Avoid magic numbers (co-location is good when necessary). **Always avoid magic strings.**

---

## Logging

- Log messages where they are created.
- Don’t propagate log messages around just to log them elsewhere.

---

## Encapsulation

- Don’t use private attributes/methods/properties from other classes/modules.
- “Private” is private—respect that boundary.

---

## SQLAlchemy guidance

- Lazy loading is often bad at scale, especially across multiple list relationships.
- Be careful when accessing SQLAlchemy object attributes:
  - It can help avoid redundant DB queries,
  - but it can also fail if accessed outside an active session,
  - and lazy loading can add hidden DB dependencies to otherwise “simple” functions.

## Trunk-based development and feature flags

- **PRs should contain no more than 500 lines of real change**
- **Merge to main frequently.** Avoid long-lived feature branches—they create merge conflicts and integration pain.
- **Use feature flags for incremental rollout.**
  - Large features should be merged in small, shippable increments behind a flag.
  - This allows continuous integration without exposing incomplete functionality.
- **Keep flags short-lived.** Once a feature is fully rolled out, remove the flag and dead code paths promptly.
- **Flag at the right level.** Prefer flagging at API/UI entry points rather than deep in business logic.
- **Test both flag states.** Ensure the codebase works correctly with the flag on and off.
