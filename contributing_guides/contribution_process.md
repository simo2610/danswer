# Contribution Process

## 1. Get the feature or enhancement approved
Create a GitHub issue and see if there are upvotes. If you feel the feature is sufficiently value additive and you would like
approval to contribute it to the repo, tag [Yuhong](https://github.com/yuhongsun96) to review.

If you do not get a response within a week, feel free to email yuhong@onyx.app and include the issue in the message.

Not all small features and enhancements will be accepted as there is a balance between feature richness and bloat.
We strive to provide the best user experience possible so we have to be intentional about what we include in the app.


## 2. Get the design approved
The Onyx team will either provide a design doc and PRD for the feature or request one from you, the contributor.

The scope and detail of the design will depend on the individual feature.


# 3. IP attribution for EE contributions
If you are contributing features to Onyx Enterprise Edition, you are required to sign the IP Assignment Agreement in the
contributing_guides directory.


## 4. Review and testing
Your features must pass all tests and all comments must be addressed prior to merging.


# Implicit agreements
If we approve an issue, we are promising you the following:
- Your work will receive timely attention and we will put aside other high priority items to ensure you are not blocked.
- You will receive necessary coaching on eng quality, system design, etc. to ensure the feature is completed well.
- The Onyx team will pull resources and bandwidth from design, PM, and engineering to ensure that you have all the
resources to build the feature to the quality required for merging.

Because this is a large investment from our team, we ask that you:
- Thoroughly read all the requirements of the design docs, engineering best practices, and try to minimize overhead for
the Onyx team.
- Complete the feature in a timely manner to reduce context switching and an ongoing resource pull from the Onyx team.
