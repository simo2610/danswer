              This check ensures that all pull requests use clear, consistent titles that help automate changelogs and improve project history.

              Please update your PR title to follow the Conventional Commits style.  
              Here is a link to a blog explaining the reason why we've included the Conventional Commits style into our PR titles: https://xfuture-blog.com/working-with-conventional-commits

              **Here are some examples of valid PR titles:**
              - feat: add user authentication
              - fix(login): handle null password error
              - docs(readme): update installation instructions"
