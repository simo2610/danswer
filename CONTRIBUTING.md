# Contributing to Onyx
Hey there! We are so excited that you're interested in Onyx.


## Contribution Opportunities
The [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/onyx-dot-app/onyx/issues) page is a great place to look for and share contribution ideas.

If you have your own feature that you would like to build please create an issue and community members can provide feedback and
thumb it up if they feel a common need. 


## Contributing Code
Please reference the documents in contributing_guides folder to ensure that the code base is kept to a high standard.
1. dev_setup.md (start here): gives you a guide to setting up a local development environment.
2. contribution_process.md: how to ensure you are building valuable features that will get reviewed and merged.
3. best_practices.md: before asking for reviews, ensure your changes meet the repo code quality standards.

To contribute, please follow the
["fork and pull request"](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) workflow.


## Getting Help 🙋
We have support channels and generally interesting discussions on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/4NA5SbzrWb).

See you there!


## Release Process
Onyx loosely follows the SemVer versioning standard.
Major changes are released with a "minor" version bump. Currently we use patch release versions to indicate small feature changes.
A set of Docker containers will be pushed automatically to DockerHub with every tag.
You can see the containers [here](https://hub.docker.com/search?q=onyx%2F).
